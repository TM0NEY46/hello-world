For those who happen to read this
My name is Tanner, I am currently expanding my knowledge and hope to one day know enough about programming and computating to create or contribute to something valuable.  Right now I have written basic functions with VBA and Java.  I am currently learning from the ground up studying binary conversion to hexadecimal to understand the basic computer processes.  Feel free to visit  my profile and see the progress as I learn how to use the amazing tool.
